          <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm really into synthesizers. Most likely beyond the point of rationale, it's a problem. I love to make crazy FX chains and program interesting musical sequences with strange gear and crazy combinations of software. Synths tend to be a natural fit for the programmer computer nerd personality with digital protocols to take advantage of like MIDI, MPE, and OSC.<br><br> 
              
            I'm also an avid gamer when I've got the time. Built my first computer at age 12 after my father noticed I installed a GPU without asking for any help. Back in my day we didn't have all this fancy RGB hoo-ha and Steam was really ugly to look at. Games came on multiple cd-roms and reinstalling Windows was practically a national past time amongst friends. Youtube was more like the dollar store version of America's Funniest Home Videos but on the internet. PHONES DIDN'T HAVE APPS.  Also we used Trillian for IM and not Discord.<br><br>  
              
            I think I have to thank video games for giving me the tech intuition I have today. In a Karate Kid style plot trope, all of the inadvertent troubleshooting I went through growing up led to a strong sense of sussing out solutions in my modern day professional career. My friends and I have rule amongst ourselves after years of LAN parties that rarely falters. Every session you start with with a new title involves probably an hour of troubleshooting if not more (especially when multiple other players are present).<br><br>

            Another benefit of this has been a lot of experience in searching for help online and communicating with others to solve a technical problems. There's nothing more annoying on a bug hunt than to <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/">find a single forum post</a> that matches your issues exactly only for OP to just say they fixed it and disappear into the digital ether. I strive to document and post my fixes in communites such as <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://pcgamingwiki.com">PCGamingWiki.</a> So that the next poor soul to lose hours to whatever weird quirk is happening with their system can save themselves the pain and sorrow and maybe pay it forward on the next bug they run into.

            I believe that the World Wide Web is and will continue to be the boldest movement for bringing 
            people together across the planet. Which is why I strongly believe in an ever changing digital age that everyone deserves the right to their privacy and digital freedom. I've also helped launch digital and privacy rights movements such as <a href="https://keepournetfree.org"/>Keep Our Net Free</p>a> which has worked in cooperation with major internet privacy groups like
            <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a> and currently has nearly 30k 
            subscribers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/">Reddit</a>.
